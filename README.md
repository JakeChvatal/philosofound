# Philosofound

A reboot of our previous Philosofound project, now written in Flask and Jinja2. 

Philosofound is designed to ask the interesting questions - the ones without a clear answer.
To contribute, simply make an account then create a question. The question will now be visible to all others with a Philosofound account! 

Other members can provide their own answers to questions or vote for current answers, then view anonymous analytics based on the demographics associated with other users.
